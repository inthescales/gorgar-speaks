# Gorgar Speaks

Gorgar Speaks is an homage to the world's first talking pinball machine, Gorgar. It generates phrases using Gorgar's six-word vocabulary.

It is also a bot on Twitter(@gorgartweets) that posts these phrases.

## Usage

To run Gorgar Speaks in the console, run gorgar.py with the flag '--test'. It will generate an utterance and print it to the console.

To generate more entries at once, use the flag '-c' followed by an integer value.

## Requirements

Gorgar Speaks only runs on Python 3.

## Posting on social media

Gorgar Speaks uses Bot Buddy for posting to its social media accounts. Bot Buddy does not currently exist in any package manager, but you can find the [source on Github](https://github.com/inthescales/bot-buddy).
